## What is AI Lead Qualification?

AI lead qualification uses artificial intelligence to conduct initial conversations with prospects, asking qualifying questions to determine buying intent, budget, timeline, and fit. Unlike traditional forms or human cold calling, AI voice agents engage prospects in natural conversations 24/7.

**Key capabilities:**
- Ask dynamic qualifying questions based on responses
- Score leads using BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) framework
- Update CRM automatically with qualification data
- Route hot leads to sales reps instantly
- Nurture cold leads through automated follow-up

## Why Traditional Lead Qualification Fails

### The Human Bottleneck
Sales reps spend 60-70% of their time on non-selling activities. Manual lead qualification is:
- **Time-intensive:** 15-20 minutes per lead
- **Inconsistent:** Quality varies by rep experience
- **Limited hours:** Only works during business hours
- **Expensive:** $50-100 per hour for SDRs

### Form-Based Qualification Issues
Website forms convert at 2-3% and provide limited data:
- 70% of forms are abandoned
- No context on urgency or buying signals
- Can't handle objections or questions
- Static questions miss key qualifying criteria

## How AI Voice Agents Qualify Leads

### The Process
1. **Instant Engagement:** AI calls prospects within 2 minutes of inquiry
2. **Dynamic Conversation:** Adapts questions based on responses
3. **Intelligent Scoring:** Assigns lead scores in real-time
4. **Smart Routing:** Connects qualified leads to sales reps
5. **Automated Follow-up:** Nurtures unqualified leads over time

### Technology Stack
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for conversation understanding

Plan for unusual questions and scenarios. Update scripts based on real conversations.
